    "Iowa alcohol study.  Using data from 2015 and the first quarter of 2016 I made predictions of the alcohol sales in Iowa for 2016.  I used a linear regression model with cross validation from sklearn.  I used both Ridge and Lasso regression methods and the both improved the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "The data set from Iowa is large so I used the set that was composed of 10% of the full set.   I made my final projections using the full set.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Lessons learned from this exercise...  don't get obsessed with a small number of nulls in a large data set.  I spent too many hours writing code to try and have the computer correct some of its errors.   It was more an excise in python for me.  Since I am still a novice at python that was a good exercise.  Not long after I got my code to work, I learned about a 'map' function that would do what I had written much faster.   The time I spent there could have been spent on other aspects.   It is probably best to build a simple model early on with a simplified data set and then decorate it as you have time.   \n",
    "\n",
    "I was interesting to see how much difference there was in using the full data set after working with the 10% sampling set.   With the small data set my projection of sales increase was about 2.2%  With the large set, it was about 4% (rough average of Lasso and Ridge). Initially, I would have thought there wouldn't have been that much of a difference with a 10% sampling.  \n",
    "\n",
    "I chose to do the first approach. \n",
    "\n",
    "My model of using counties as dummy variables was a fairly simple one.  The scores came out nicely and the projections seemed to be well within reason.  The number of times I have heard in class about using simpler models has had an effect.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Things I enjoyed about this project. There were severeal highs and (very) lows during this. One of them, I referred to earlier about being able to write some code that made the computer use what it knew to correct some nulls.  The fact that I got that to work was satisfying. Another high point was where I had generated a sum of one of the sales column (for each store).   What was frustrating was that even though the info was printed out in front of me, I couldn't access it very easily.  After walking away from it a few hours later it came to mind that what I was looking at looked alot like a dictionary so I tried a 'to_dict\" on it and, thankfully, it worked and the data I wanted was finally easily usable.   I was also nice when, after spending unknown amounts of hours generating the data, I put it into the code for the modeling software and it gave me an answer that wasn't nutty.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Things I didn't like. One of the odder moments was when I had made a data frame what was 1400 by 99 (# stores and the variables).  I wanted to pull out one of the columns from that so it should be 1400,1... it came out with one more row listed...????   1401!!!??   I had several people look at it including Sam.  No one could determine why.  I went back to the start of my code and re-ran it.  It didn't appear again - thank God!.   "
