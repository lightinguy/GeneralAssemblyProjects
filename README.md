Projects from DC-DSI-3 (2016-2017)

Ground Level Ozone - Modeling ground level ozone with data from the EPA.
Ground level ozone is an atmospheric pollutant that is formed by
chemical reactions between oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and volatile organic
compounds (VOC) in the presence of sunlight.  Several different modeling
approaches were used to predict if the level of ozone was above a
threshold. They included SVM, Logistic Regression, and various decision
tree methods were used.

West Nile Virus in Chicago - An analysis of mosquito traps in Chicago
(team project).  Worked with two exceptional women from the DC-DSI-3 cohort,
Ritika and Parisa.  Initial research I did found that the length of day was 
an important variable so we included it in our model.  Our team won 1st place
for best presentation. 

Iowa Liquor Sales - Project 2016 sales based on model built on data from
2015.  The data on liquor sales came from the state of Iowa.  We were given
a listing of every wholesale purchase of alcohol (not beer or wine) for Iowa
in 2015 and the first quarter of 2016. I used a linear regression approach 
and built a model for the 1st quarter of 2015 with the target being the total 
sales for 2015.  I then used that model and the 1st quarter of 2016 to project 
sales for 2016.  

2015 sales. United States SAT Scores - Analyze and explain observed
average state SAT scores. The data was composed of the SAT (math and verbal) 
scores for each state (and DC).  I analyzed the data and presented a strong 
case that states where the ACT is prevalent only the top students take the
SAT and that affects the average SAT scores for those states.  


Global Terror Database - Bayesian comparison of France and UK bomb
attacks.  The Global Terror Database (GTD) is a collection of data about
terror attacks that have occurred anywhere in the world from 1970 till
2015.   I did a Bayesian analysis of the number of terror related
bombings in the UK and France.  Then, I focused in on the USA to get an
idea of how safe we are within our borders.   Finally, I impute some
1993 missing data.

Web-Scraping the Indeed Job Site - Gather/analyze job salary info from
the Indeed web site. The Indeed.com job posting web site is one of the
major aggregators of science related job openings.  Company name,
location, job titles, salary information and other relevant information
was ‘scraped’ from the Indeed web pages as well as related pages posted
by the companies that were looking to hire someone for a data
science/analyst related job.  Information from more than 1000 job
postings was gathered using web scraping techniques. That information
was analyzed and used to build two different models that could be used
to indicate if the pay for a job would be more than the median income
for a data related science job in the DC area.
